# Atmos

## Running POCs
Each POC is in the same app.

The project is using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as its package manager, in place of npm.

If not already done, install pnpm:

```
npm install -g pnpm@next-7
```

Then clone the repo and checkout the `pocs` branch.

Install dependencies:
```
pnpm install
```

Then run the project:
```
pnpm run dev
```

The project will be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
